Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.
#1 N
#2
i =constant
while N 
N/2 ?
(N/1)/(N/2)= 2N/N = 2 = constant?
#3
i = N
j = N
k = N
N*N*N = N^3 ?
#4 N = constant, not changing
N is used on 2 loops, although the value doesn't change, so N*N = N^2
#5
N*N*N*N: N^4
#6
2^N
#7
2^N

Exercise II
#a
let maxDiff;
const findMax = function(array, constValue) => {
    for (let i = 0; array.length > i: i++) {
        if ((array[constantValue] - array[i]) > maxDiff) {
            maxDiff = array[constantValue] - array[i]
        }
    }
}

#b
?

Exercise III
a)Because the array is already sorted, it will take the most time to organize, it's the worst case scenario, N ?
b)log(N) because the quicksort looks to be a constant function, if it starts in the middle than it might be log(N).
